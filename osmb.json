Selling 75 shares at $30 each calculates profit on this average cost.\n\nCorrect Response Examples: {\"answer\": \"600\"} // Correct format for a positive number\n{\"answer\": \"-800\"} // Correct format for a negative number\n{\"answer\": \"NVDA\"} // Example for a non numeric answer\n\nIncorrect Response Examples (to avoid): {\"answer\": 400} // Numerical values must be in double quotes\n{\"Answer\": \"some answer\"} // \"answer\" must be all lowercase",
